This was completed with [Luke](https://github.com/lusketeer). See my related blog post [here](http://blog.cssherry.com/post/104746682869/w1d1-arrays-strings-hashes-enumerables). 

## Week 1
### w1d1
* Primitive Ruby types (common methods)
* Debugging
* Running/loading Ruby code

# How to Run These Files
These files require Ruby to run. The best tutorial I've found is this: [Ruby Installation Tutorial](http://installrails.com/steps)

Once Ruby is installed, download the files, go into terminal, and either run files individually

$ ruby 01_towers_of_hanoi.rb

or run them through irb

$ irb
$ load '01_towers_of_hanoi.rb'
