# How to Run These Files
These files require Ruby to run. The best tutorial I've found is this: [Ruby Installation Tutorial](http://installrails.com/steps)

Once Ruby is installed, download the files, go into terminal, and run files individually. You should be in the main poker folder to run any poker specs.

$ rspec spec/deck_spec.rb

or run them through irb

$ irb
$ load 'spec/deck_spec.rb'
