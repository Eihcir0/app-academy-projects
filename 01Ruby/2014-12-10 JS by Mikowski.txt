# Archiecture: write in modular fashion
  browser specific stuff, model specific stuff, and server specific stuff

# Conventions
  pick datatype and name. Use indicator. Don't make variable plural

easy to create global variables
however, if you scope to function, you won't make a global variable
also can type //use strict to make strict mode on functional scope. Don't want to do this on global scale

can do declaration and assignment on the same line.
try to only have one var declaration per function, put assignment on separate line

# hoisting
  will hoist declaration of variable, will pull all the way to the top
  so declare all variables at once

# scope chain: symbol defined in nested function is available globally and will overwrite outer-most definition of the variable

# Not class-based object, uses prototype-based object.

 key value stores
    _proto_ : chain refers to the type of prototype an object is in
    don't need to activate or create new object from class.
    hasOwnProperty available on object, lets you know what is set on the innermost, closest to you object class/prototype

  use object create, not prototype.new

# Execution context object: Javascript creates object that cannot be touched everytime you execute a command
  2 passes-- 1) goes through and hoists declarations to the top
  2) runs the code
  if there is function within a function, will fill the innermost function first
  when reference count to variable is down to 0, then will be garbage collected.

# Closures can cause memory leaks
don't declar function in a loop to prevent memory leaks

#garbage collecting: will reallocate memory-- when too much memory allocated, will reallocate to smaller space

#self-executing anonymouse function: function declaration will execute function immediately using functions:
(function ($) { //can also use use_strict code here
  var warningMsg
} )

# Can create modules to make scope of variable within function

typically put within function and name it so that it will have namespace. This way, only use one variable for that function
