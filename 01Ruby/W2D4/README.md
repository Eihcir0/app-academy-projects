This was completed solo. See my related blog post [here](http://blog.cssherry.com/post/105591360644/w2d4-solo-programming-checkers-and-the-beauty-of).

## Week 2
### W2D4
* Checkers

# How to Run These Files
These files require Ruby to run. The best tutorial I've found is this: [Ruby Installation Tutorial](http://installrails.com/steps)

Once Ruby is installed, download the files, go into terminal, and either run files individually

$ ruby checkers.rb

or run them through irb

$ irb
$ load 'checkers.rb'
