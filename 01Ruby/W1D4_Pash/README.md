# How to Run These Files
These files require Ruby to run. The best tutorial I've found is this: [Ruby Installation Tutorial](http://installrails.com/steps)

Once Ruby is installed, download the files, go into terminal, and either run files individually

$ ruby wordchain.rb

or run them through irb (recommended)

$ irb
$ load 'wordchain.rb'
