# How to Run These Files
These files require Ruby and SQL to run. The best ruby tutorial I've found is this: [Ruby Installation Tutorial](http://installrails.com/steps). To run SQL, just install [Postgres](http://www.postgresql.org/).

Once Ruby and SQL are installed, download the files, go into terminal, cd to the directory that contains the lib and spec folders, and either run files individually.

$ rspec spec/01_select_basics_spec.rb
