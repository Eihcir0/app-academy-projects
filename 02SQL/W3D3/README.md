# How to Run These Files
These files require Ruby and SQL to run. The best ruby tutorial I've found is this: [Ruby Installation Tutorial](http://installrails.com/steps). To run SQL, just install [Postgres](http://www.postgresql.org/).

Once Ruby is installed, download the files, go into terminal, navigate to either the AssociationsExercise-master or URLShortener folder, bundle install, and play with it via the rails console.

$ rails c

or run the URLShortener through

$ rails runner bin/cli
