# How to Run These Files
These files require Ruby and SQL to run. The best ruby tutorial I've found is this: [Ruby Installation Tutorial](http://installrails.com/steps). To run SQL, just install [Postgres](http://www.postgresql.org/).

Once Ruby is installed, download the files, go into terminal, and either run files individually

$ ruby questions.rb

or run them through irb

$ irb
$ load 'questions.rb'
