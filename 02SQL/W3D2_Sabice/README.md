# App Academy Projects
====================
This was partially completed with [Sabice](https://github.com/nihilence), partially solo. See my related blog post [here](http://blog.cssherry.com/post/106500689244/w3d2-sql-ruby).

### W3D2
* SQL + Ruby
* SQLite3
* Heredocs

# How to Run These Files
These files require Ruby and SQL to run. The best ruby tutorial I've found is this: [Ruby Installation Tutorial](http://installrails.com/steps). To run SQL, just install [Postgres](http://www.postgresql.org/).

Once Ruby is installed, download the files, go into terminal, and either run files individually

$ ruby questions.rb

or run them through irb

$ irb
$ load 'questions.rb'
